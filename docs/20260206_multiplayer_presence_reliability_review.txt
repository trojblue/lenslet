Review pass source: `codex exec` run on 2026-02-06 against `docs/20260206_multiplayer_presence_reliability_plan.md`.

Concise actionable feedback captured from the run:
- Add browser unload caveat explicitly: `pagehide`/`visibilitychange`/`unload` do not guarantee async fetch completion; include beacon/keepalive strategy.
- Treat presence/replay as process-local operational dependency and document single-worker constraint explicitly.
- Split oversized tickets into atomic lifecycle route tasks (`join`, `move`, `leave`) and compatibility task for legacy `/presence` heartbeat.
- Add lease-based session guard (`lease_id`) to prevent client-id-only eviction races and stale leave hazards.
- Tighten acceptance criteria with measurable bounds for explicit move/leave and crash/no-leave prune convergence.
- Expand test plan to include lifecycle invariants, concurrent race checks, reconnect reconciliation, and browser lifecycle dispatch paths.
- Add rollout/rollback gate so lifecycle-v2 can be staged and reverted safely.
