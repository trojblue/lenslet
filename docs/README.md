# Docs Guide

## Active vs Historical

- Active working docs live directly under `docs/` (for example current execution plans and dev notes).
- Historical agent-era material lives under `docs/agents_archive/`.
- Treat `docs/agents_archive/` as reference only, not current source-of-truth, unless a task explicitly asks for historical context.

## Ralph Workspaces

- Ralph run workspaces live under `docs/ralph/`.
- Default naming convention: `docs/ralph/<YYYYMMDD_slug>/`.
- See `docs/ralph/README.md` for workspace contents.
